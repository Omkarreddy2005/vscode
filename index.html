<h1>VISUAL STUDIO CODE</h1>
    <img src="flg.avif" width="50%">
<p style="font-size: 25px;">Visual Studio Code is a very popular coding editor used by millions of developers around the world.<br></p>
<p style="font-size: 25px;">These are some characteristics that bring VSCode to the top of the coding editors but there are also others that I want to talk with you in this article.</p>

   <h2> 1. Open-source</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">The fact that the VS Code is mostly open-source is an unprecedented advantage.<br>
    
    Not only does it mean that the software is free to use, but also that you can help to improve it<br>
    Going open-source is a great choice if you want to increase the community engagement.<br>

    While not all VS Code users contribute to its codebase, they get a certain feeling of unity.<br>
    
    Other code editors such as Atom and even whole IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans are also open-source.</p>
    <h2>2.Simplicity</h2>

       <p style="font-size: 25px;"> From the first steps to installing new extensions, everything in VS Code feels simple and intuitive.<br>
        
        With that said, I don’t imply that the VS Code is lacking in any way in terms of features, not at all.<br>
        
        Thanks to its extendable architecture (which we’ll talk about in a moment), VS Code, even when being just a code editor, can be a valuable alternative to other more complex IDEs.<br>
        
        But, unlike those IDEs, it still manages to do it in a compact, user-friendly way.<br>
        
        This simplicity also shows through the VS Code performance, which is surprisingly good, especially for an Electron app.</p>
        <h2>3. Familiarity</h2>

          <p style="font-size: 25px;">  VS Code is built using Electron — a framework for creating desktop apps with JavaScript with the help of Chromium and Node.js.<br>
            
            Many web developers using VS Code are aware of and appreciate this fact but not all do, mainly because of Electron apps notorious high memory usage and low performance.<br>
            
            On the other hand, VS Code utilizes its impressive TypeScript integration to power autocompletion and other useful editing features for both JS and TS.<br>
            
            If you’re using TypeScript, it could be said that VS Code is your best bet.<br>
            
            So, the fact that VS Code is built on top of web technologies and also provides great support for them, makes it feel familiar and pretty much the default choice for a large portion of its growing user-base, web developers.</p>
  <h2>4. Extensions</h2>

   <p style="font-size: 25px;"> There are literally thousands of extensions in the VS Code marketplace with new ones coming seemingly every single day!<br>
    Extensions can serve many purposes.<br>

From extension-like UI themes to programming language support, debugging, Git integration, and even Spotify players!<br>

You can easily make your own with the help of some JavaScript/TypeScript and detailed docs.<br>

Extensions are very important because they make the VS Code what it currently is, a very capable piece of software.<br>

Without them, VS Code would be not much beyond glorified text editor with good design and basic autocompletion here and there.<br>

Extensions are really important to customizing your software to suit your personal needs.
